## emonHub settings

# Edit this to configure the parameters used in
# the /etc/init.d/emonhub script.

# n.b. The emonhub install script currently overwrites
# this file, but creates a backup.

# This file should be deployed to /etc/default/emonhub
# unless you have edited the init.d file to give an
# alternate SYSCONF_PATH

# If started from the default systemd service file,
# the optional file /etc/default/emonhub.local
# is used after this file, and will override any
# settings defined here.

# Specify the directory in which emonhub.py is found:
EMONHUB_PATH=/usr/share/emonhub/

# Specify the full config file path:
EMONHUB_CONFIG=/home/pi/data/emonhub.conf

# Specify the full log file path:
# (not used with systemd see below for alternative)
EMONHUB_LOG=/var/log/emonhub/emonhub.log

# With systemd, emonhub uses the journald service to log
# messages by default, you can use commands such as:
#
# journalctl -u emonhub -f
#
# ... to follow log file output.  See:
#
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs
#
# for more options.
#
# If you wish to override this, and still use a separate log
# file, then you may use the commented out directive below
#
# It's recommended that you place this directive in
# /etc/default/emonhub.local to prevent the emonhub git
# repository 'install' script clobbering your changes.
#
# You should ensure this log file exists and is writable by
# the emonhub user.

#SYSTEMD_EXTRA_ARGS="--logfile /var/log/emonhub/emonhub.log"
